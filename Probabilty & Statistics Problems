Examples
--------
1.1 We roll a six-sided die. What is the probability that a multiple of 3 will occur?
1.2 We toss a fair coin. What is the probability that we get heads?
1.3 If we toss a fair coin twice, what is the probability that we get at least 1 tail?
1.4 We roll a red die and a green die simultaneously. What is the probability that we roll a 7?
1.5 If we toss 3 coins, what are all of the possible probabilities for getting heads?
1.6 What is the probability of drawing 1 queen from an ordinary deck of cards?
1.7 What is the probability of tossing a fair coin twice and getting heads both times?
1.8 What is the probability of tossing a fair coin 6 times in a row and getting heads each time?
1.9 What is the probability of drawing 2 queens in a row from a deck of playing cards?
1.10 What is the probability of drawing 2 spades in a row (a) with replacement and (b) without replacement?
1.11 If we toss a fair coin 4 times, what is the probability of getting at least 1 head?
1.12 We toss a fair coin 10 times. What is the probability that we get at least 1 head?
