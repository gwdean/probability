* There is no knowledge more certain than that provided by induction.
* All arguments must trace eventually back to some foundation.
* This foundational knowledge is first present in the senses.
* Through intellection (i.e. induction), first principles, universals and essences are discovered.
* Induction is what accounts for our being certain, after observing only a finite number of instances...
* Induction is analogical.
